  ## Description
  This extraordinary application allows users to explore the world of the magnificent platypus. You'll learn all about their lives and how to protect their future.
  <br>

  For my application, I used the following technologies:  HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NodeJS, Markdown, GitHub, Git.
  <br><br>
  There were a few challenges in making this project. The main one is that there are only a few platypuses in North America. I was happy to be able to collaborate with the San Diego Zoo, but their tech was rudimentary and required a lot of updates.
  <br><br>
  In the future, I would like to fund a trip to Australia to find more collaborators at the Sydney Platypus Expo. With their assistance, we could add a streaming feature to the app to bring the wonderful platypus acrobats Down Under to the whole world.
