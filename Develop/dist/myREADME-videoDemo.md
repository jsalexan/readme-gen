  ## Description
  This is a simple landing page to support the fundraising efforts of the Seattle Platypus Rescue. While the site, like the organization, is still under development, we wanted to start building their profile in the community and assist in collecting volunteers that will assist with various tasks. The page features a basic navigation menu, for future pages, along with the beginnings of a volunteer form. Most prominently, it features Cosmo and Roxy, two rescued puggles. 
  <br>

  For my application, I used the following technologies: HTML, CSS, Markdown, GitHub, Git..
  <br><br>
  There were a few challenges in making this project. One of the first challenges was coordinating with an organization that’s still in its infancy. As there are currently no platypuses in North America, you can imagine the difficulty of starting a rescue. But we were tasked with getting the ball rolling on fundraising, so the form will be crucial in getting that going. 
  <br><br>
  In the future, we’d like to add a check box menu of interests for our volunteers. Users will be able to choose to donate, answer phones, bath the platypuses, or simply buy a puggle a bottle of hot coffee. We’d also like to add the Google Maps API to help users locate their nearest neighborhood shelter when they come across an abandoned platypus. And a photo gallery or carousel of images would be nice addition.
