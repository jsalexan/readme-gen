## Description
My application introduces the user to the world of the platypus. It brings together facts, conservation ideas, interactive experiences, and lots of fun for the platypus 
<br>
 Mainly JavaScript.
<br>
It was challenging integrating my work with the websites of my collaborators in San Diego and Sydney.
<br>
We'll be adding a Platypus Live Cam and a fundraising section down the road.
