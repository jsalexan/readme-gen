## Description
This application is a simple password generator.
<br>
For my application, I used the following technologies: JavaScript
<br>
It was challenging getting the prompts to work and to figure out how to clear the input to use the generator a second time.
<br>
In the future, I would like to make the generator more secure. Perhaps the passwords could be encrypted.
