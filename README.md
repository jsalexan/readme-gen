  ## Description
  This application allows any user to easily create a README file for their application. They simply answer the prompts and provide whatever information they like and the file is generated automatically. 
  <br><br>

  For my application, I used the following technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NodeJS, JSON, NPM, Inquirer, Git Bash, GitHub.
  <br><br>
  There were a few challenges in getting this the way I wanted it. I had the application itself running fairly quickly, but then when I attempted to integrate the starter code, it got a bit more challenging. After a lot of tinkering, I was able to get it all integrated. It was interesting thinking through the different ways I could use an app like this, as I regularly create README files. I was also deadset on finding a way to add a screenshot, so that was fun to figure out.
  <br><br>
  I would like to figure out how to add multiple links easier, like in the 3rd Party Application section. This might include a prompt asking if the user is done or if they'd like to add another link. I would also like to add the option to include other types of badges.
